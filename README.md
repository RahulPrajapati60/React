# Why React?
### We can use states which means that once we update the state variable, it changes across the page
### We can split our app into multiple components and reuse those components
### React uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update the UI which is better than updating content using DOM Manipulation
### Debugging and maintainance is easy

# useEffect
### In React, the `useEffect` hook handles side effects in functional components, like data fetching or DOM updates. It runs after render and takes a callback function and an optional dependency array
